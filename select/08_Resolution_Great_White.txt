Six in the morning, that's the moment I hate
I stayed up all night and now I'm running late

Lay down the bottle, put down the smoke
Can't find my keys, where the hell's my coat?
Look out the window, here comes the rain
Oh, my god, I feel the pain

Yeah, yeah, my resolution
(Is) to make it through another day
Yeah, yeah, my resolution
Ain't nothing else I want to say

They towed my car, too many tickets were due
Oh, when I look in the sky, there's not a touch of blue
Not a touch of blue, yeah

It don't matter if I'm right or wrong
I'm always singing the same old song
I need a life I can call my own
Come on, come on, throw me a bone

Yeah, yeah, my resolution
(Is) to make it through another day
Yeah, yeah, my resolution
Ain't nothing else I want to say

I want to make it through
Ooh, I'm down on my knees
Please somebody show me
Somebody show me the way

Ain't got no luck, ain't got no life
Ain't got no woman to please at night
Ain't got no future to call my own
Somebody, come on, throw me a bone

Yeah, yeah, my resolution
(Is) to make it through another day
Yeah, yeah, my resolution
Ain't nothing else I can say

Yeah, yeah, my resolution
(Is) to make it through another day
Yeah, yeah, my resolution
There's nothing else I want to say

My resolution
My resolution
